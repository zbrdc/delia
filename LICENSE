GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can use it too for your programs.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and developers' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to forbid the practice for those products. If such problems arise in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, redistribution, reverse engineering, display, performance, and public transmission.

A "contributor" is an author or any other entity who exercises copyright control over a work licensed under this License. "You" collectively refers to all contributors.

An "effective license" is any license that is compatible with this License.

A "distributor" is an individual or entity who conveys a work or works covered by this License to others.

"You" refers to the user, who is either an individual or a legal entity.

"Derived work" is a work containing or based on the Program or on a work containing or based on the Program.

"Distribute" means to convey the Program to anyone.

A "user product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the particular user's expectations, or of the particular user's actual use, or of all commercial or non-commercial uses.

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functionality of the modified software is in no case prevented or impaired because of your having made modifications.

"Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source code for that work, including any interface definition files, and any scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the Corresponding Source need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

1. Source Code.

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

A "Free System Distribution" is a System Distribution that contains only works that are Free Software and that are licensed under terms that allow them to be combined with other Free Software into a larger work.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not distribute, without any conditions other than that this License remains in force. You may run the Program privately, for any purpose, and you may prepare and display publicly a work based on the Program without restriction.

You may propagate a covered work to others only if you meet the conditions of this License and applicable law. The act of propagating a covered work for which propagation is prohibited constitutes a modification and a violation of this License. If you distribute a copy of the covered work, you may choose to make it available under other licenses if you are permitted to do so by applicable law.

3. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

4. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 3, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 3 to "keep intact all notices".
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display an "About" box or equivalent feature that displays at least the following information: an appropriate copyright notice; a license notice giving the user permission to copy the Program and an indication that there is no warranty. If the work was an interactive user interface, then the "About" box must include the information specified in section 3.

A covered work is an aggregation with a separate and independent work, if the aggregation is not a derivative of the covered work. The covered work, and any other work, are separate and independent works in an aggregation, so long as the covered work is licensed under this License, and the aggregation as a whole is not.

You may convey a compiled or executable version of a covered work only if you also convey the Corresponding Source in accord with section 3, and only if the Corresponding Source is available under this License. You may also convey the object code in a User Product.

5. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 3 and 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) Convey the object code in a User Product.
b) Convey the Corresponding Source in accord with section 3.
c) Provide installation information, which need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
d) For any work containing or based on the Program that you distribute, you must provide, along with the object code, the complete Corresponding Source in machinereadable format under the terms of a license that is compatible with this License.

6. Terms That Apply to All Covered Works.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of the rights granted under this License, or assert or imply that you have exclusive rights to the Program.

7. No Warranties.

THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

8. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

9. Interpreting Sections 7 and 8.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply a construction that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all liability and a disclaimer of all warranty, unless such a construction would render the License null and void.

10. End of Terms.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose license conditions are incompatible with this License, write to the Free Software Foundation to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, ask the Free Software Foundation.

11. Changes to the Program.

You may not make any changes to the Program that would prevent it from working with the free software released under this License, or that would make it work only with proprietary software. This is to ensure that the Program remains free software and can be used with other free software.

12. Termination.

You may not propagate a covered work if you are a party to a lawsuit that makes a copyright claim for infringement of the rights for any work covered by this License, and you fail to obtain a written waiver from the copyright holder that permits you to continue to propagate the covered work.

13. Patent Protection.

This License includes the provisions of section 11 of GPLv2, which states:

Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

"Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source code for that work, including any interface definition files, and any scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the Corresponding Source need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

14. Trademarks.

This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Free Software Foundation, unless it is for the purpose of describing the origin of a work covered by this License.

15. Indemnification.

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Free Software Foundation and its contractors, employees, agents, distributors, and licensees from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in connection with your use or distribution of any covered work.
